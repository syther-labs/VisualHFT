The paper's method splits a bucket's volume fractionally between the two sides; assigning each whole print to one side can only produce buckets at least as one-sided, so expect this to read higher than a bulk-classified figure on the same tape. That follows from the two constructions - it is not a measurement, and no bulk classifier ships here to compare against. Compare ranks and percentiles rather than published absolute thresholds.
