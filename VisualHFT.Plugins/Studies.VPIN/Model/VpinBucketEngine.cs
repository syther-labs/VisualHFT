    /// Computes VPIN over volume buckets built from a public trade tape, in the corrected form.
    ///
    /// THE PUBLISHED CONSTRUCTION
    /// Easley, Lopez de Prado and O'Hara (2012) define the metric as the mean absolute volume
    /// imbalance across the last n completed buckets of equal traded volume V:
    ///
    ///     VPIN = (1/n) * SUM |V_buy_i - V_sell_i| / V
    ///
    /// The volume clock is what makes the metric a real-time one: a bucket closes when volume
    /// reaches V, not when a wall-clock interval expires, so the reading advances with activity
    /// rather than with time. This engine keeps that construction, including splitting a print
    /// that straddles a bucket boundary and carrying the remainder into the next bucket.
    ///
    /// WHERE IT DEPARTS FROM THE PAPER, AND WHY
    /// The paper classifies a bucket's volume in bulk, splitting it between buy and sell from the
    /// bucket's price change scaled by the volatility of price changes, and never looks at an
    /// individual print's side. Andersen and Bondarenko (2015) showed that this classifier is a
    /// function of volatility, so a metric built on it tracks volatility mechanically; Chakrabarty,
    /// Pascual and Shkilko (2015) found the tick rule produces more accurate estimates of the same
    /// quantity. This engine therefore classifies with the tick rule: a print above the previous
    /// print is a buy, below is a sell, and an unchanged price repeats the previous side.
    ///
    /// A level shift follows from that, and callers must state it. The bulk method splits a bucket's
    /// volume fractionally between the two sides, while this assigns each whole print to one of them,
    /// which can only produce buckets at least as one-sided. Expect this to read higher than a
    /// bulk-classified figure on the same tape - expect, not measure: no such comparison has been run,
    /// and the product ships no bulk classifier to compare against. The legacy form is not one either;
    /// it also assigns whole prints, differing only in how it picks the side. Treat published absolute
    /// thresholds as untransferable and compare ranks and percentiles instead.
    ///
    /// The exchange's own aggressor flag is deliberately not used. The connectors that supply it do
    /// not agree on what it means, so a tile built on it would read backwards on some venues. The
    /// tick rule needs nothing but the print stream.
    ///
    /// WHY BUCKET SIZE DECIDES THE NUMBER
    /// A bucket holding B equally sized prints can only take the imbalance values 0, 2/B, 4/B and so
    /// on, and on coin-flip sides its expected value is 1.000 at B = 1, 0.500 at B = 2 and 0.375 at
    /// B = 4, falling toward zero only as B grows. A bucket small enough to hold one print therefore
    /// reads 1 forever on random flow, by arithmetic and not by measurement. The engine samples the
    /// first prints it sees, takes their median size, and refuses to publish while the configured
    /// bucket volume is below <see cref="MinimumPrintsPerBucket"/> times that median.
    ///
    /// WARM-UP
    /// The paper defines the metric only over a full window, so nothing is publishable until n
    /// buckets have closed. At the paper's own sizing that is roughly one trading day of volume.
    /// <see cref="WarmUpVolumeRequired"/> is that cost expressed as volume; dividing it by the
    /// instrument's volume rate gives it in wall time.
    ///
    /// THREADING
    /// This class is not thread-safe and does not try to be. It is driven from the trade callback
    /// alone, under the study's own lock. It is deliberately private to this plugin and shared with
    /// nothing outside it.
