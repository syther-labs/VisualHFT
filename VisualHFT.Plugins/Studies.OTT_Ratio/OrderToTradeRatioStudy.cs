    /// THE TWO FORMS
    /// Volume form:  OTR = (Ordered Volume / Traded Volume) - 1,
    ///               where Ordered Volume = max(Added + Removed - Traded, 0).
    ///               Added and Removed are the size that entered and left the tracked price
    ///               levels; Traded is the size of the public trade prints.
    /// Count form:   OTR = (Book changes / max(Trades, 1)) - 1, measured over each aggregation
    ///               window. Book changes counts additions, removals and modifications at the
    ///               tracked price levels, with a modification weighted twice.
    ///
    /// WHY THE VOLUME FORM ACCUMULATES OVER A WHOLE INTERVAL
    /// The volume form's three totals run from the moment the study arms, not per aggregation
    /// window. A per-window ratio goes negative under ordinary conditions: liquidity already
    /// resting in the book when the window opens is never counted as added size, yet its
    /// execution inside the window counts as both removed size and traded size. Accumulating
    /// from a single arming instant is what makes that subtraction balance. The totals reset
    /// when the study restarts and at the daily rollover.
    ///
    /// WHAT PRICE-LEVEL DATA CAN AND CANNOT SUPPORT
    /// Size leaving a price level is either a cancellation or a fill, and at this granularity
    /// the two are indistinguishable. Subtracting traded size separates them in aggregate, never
    /// order by order. Only price levels inside the configured depth are counted, so this is a
    /// market-wide figure built from public data — not a venue's per-member regulatory ratio.
    ///
    /// NO VALUE IS PUBLISHED WHEN THERE IS NOTHING TO DIVIDE BY
    /// In the volume form, no public trade means no ratio: the study publishes a model with no
    /// value assigned at all, and the tile shows a dot. The denominator is never floored to
    /// reach a number. This matters because -1 is itself a legitimate output — the count form
    /// emits exactly -1 when a window carries no book changes — so a value can never double as
    /// a "no data" marker. Absence of data is signalled by the absence of a value.
    ///
    /// THREAD SAFETY
    /// The order-book stream and the trade stream are independent dispatchers. Their callbacks
    /// can run at the same time on different threads, and nothing orders a trade print against
    /// the book change that produced it. Every total written from more than one callback is
    /// advanced with Interlocked and is an order-insensitive sum; the baseline readings used to
    /// turn cumulative counters into deltas are single-writer state, touched only by the
